   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* InterZone Surface Areas -- mismatch
   ************* ..Area mismatch errors happen when the interzone surface in zone A is
   ************* ..not the same size as it's companion in zone B.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
